## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

* Rust toolchain (version 1.70 or newer)
* Access to the `root` account (no `sudo` or `doas` required)

1. **Switch to the root user**:
```
su -
```
2. **Run the installer from the project root**:
```
./install.sh
```
This script will:

Compile elev in release mode

Install the binary to /usr/bin/elev

Create a default config at /etc/elev.conf

## Configuration

The default configuration file is located at /etc/elev.conf. Define rules using human-readable syntax. Available keywords:

    allow / deny

    user or :group

    role=<role_name>

    as <target_user>

    cmd <pattern> (wildcards *, ?, or full regex)

    priority <0-255>

## Example rule format:

    allow <user_or_:group> [role=<role_name>] [as <target_user>] cmd <pattern> [priority <n>]

## Examples

    # Allow user "alice" to run "journalctl" as root at any time
    allow alice role=admin as root cmd journalctl

    # Allow any member of group "admins" to run any command as any user, high priority
    allow :admins role=superuser cmd * priority 100

    # Deny all users from rebooting or shutting down the system
    deny all cmd reboot
    deny all cmd shutdown

## Usage

Invoke **elev** just like you would `sudo` or `doas`:

    $ elev journalctl -xe
